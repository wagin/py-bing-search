============

Remember to set the `API_KEY` as your own.

    >>> from py_bing_search import PyBingSearch
    >>> bing = PyBingSearch('Your-Api-Key-Here')
    >>> result_list, next_uri = bing.search("Python Software Foundation", limit=50, format='json')

You can also run *search_all* to keep search going until it fills your required quota

    >>> result_list = bing.search_all("Python Software Foundation", limit=130, format='json')
    >>> len(result_list) == 130
    True
    >>>

result_list is a list of search results. next_uri is the search link to the next page

    >>> result_list[0].description
    u'Python Software Foundation Home Page. The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to ...'
    
    >>> for result in result_list:
    ...     print result.url
    ...
    u'http://www.python.org/psf/
    ...
